## 🐦 hosting and joining

1. **install sparrow-rtc**
    ```sh
    npm i sparrow-rtc
    ```
1. **be a host: allow peers to join you**
    ```ts
    import {Sparrow} from "sparrow-rtc"

    const sparrow = await Sparrow.connect({
      joined: peer => {
        console.log("peer connected")
        peer.channels.unreliable.send("world")
        peer.channels.unreliable.onmessage = m => console.log(m.data)
        return () => console.log("peer disconnected")
      },
      closed: () => console.log("disconnected from sparrow"),
    })
    ```
    - this creates a websocket connection to the sparrow signaling server
    - people can join using the invite string
      ```ts
      sparrow.invite
        // "8ab469956da27aff3825a3681b4f6452"
      ```
1. **be a client: connect to the host via the invite**
    ```ts
    import {Sparrow} from "sparrow-rtc"

    const sparrow = await Sparrow.connect({
      closed: () => console.log("disconnected from sparrow"),
    })

    const peer = await sparrow.join({
      invite: "8ab469956da27aff3825a3681b4f6452",
      closed: () => console.log("disconnected from peer"),
    })
    ```
